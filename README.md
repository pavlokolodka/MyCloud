## üöÄ Installation

To run MyCloud on your local machine, you'll need to have Git and Node.js installed. Follow the steps below:

1. Clone the MyCloud repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavlokolodka/MyCloud.git
```
2. Create a .env file by making a copy of .env.example. This file will contain the configuration for your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
3. Install the project dependencies using npm
```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the MyCloud server. There are two available scripts depending on the mode you want to run:<br/>
- For production mode:
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```
- For development mode (with nodemon for auto-reloading):<br/>
```bash
npm run dev
```
Alternative way using Docker: 

1. Clone the MyCloud repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pavlokolodka/MyCloud.git
```

2. Create a .env file by making a copy of .env.example. This file will contain the configuration for your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Build the Docker image using the Dockerfile. This will create a Docker image named `mycloud`
```bash
docker build . -t mycloud
```
4. Run the Docker container as a daemon using the newly created image.
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 -d mycloud
```
